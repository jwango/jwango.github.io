By that I literally mean that there was much unwanted sap that I had to scoop out and then fill in with wood filler.

The top rails were designed at an angle so I angled the tenons themselves to match the differing heights in the mortises of the front and back legs.

By drilling the holes slightly offset in the tenon, I could squeeze the joint extra tight while letting the pin absorb the tension.
