The goal is to construct a strong, functional, and a pleasing piece of furniture. With the planned joints, it will serve as a great skill-building project following the last stool project.

For instance, I would probably remove the ornmaments typically reserved for post caps. I understand the need for a removable stretcher that solidifes the front-end of the wings that open up, but at least on the bottom side I am thinking of upgrading it to be a fall-down shelf. This will add the convenience of shelf-space for short & flat materials while also solidiying the bottom structure when open.\"},{\"kind\":\"p\",\"content\":\"My only hesistation is that adding surfaces and shelves runs contrary to a portable and minimal nature. It crosses that line from \\\"stowable when not in use\\\" to something more \\\"convenient for packing up when moving\\\".

With angled mortise & tenons it's probably wise to angle the tenon rather than the mortise, given how much easier it is to saw the tenon at an angle than to chop the mortise at an angle. I will just have to consider the angle of the splay and how it might affect the fit & strength of the mortise & tenon.
